= ActiveAdmin Pages

This gem is a plugin for ActiveAdmin [http://activeadmin.info/] that provides a model and interface for static pages.

It doesn't add anything to your routes, but something like "match '*path' => 'pages#show'
" below your other routes will get the job done. Of course, you'll need a view and controller for pages#show!
